// Given a set of n integers where n <= 40.
// Each of them is at most 10^12.
// determine the maximum sum subset having sum less than or equal S where S <= 10^18.


// Brute Force:
// find all possible subset sums of N integers 
// check if it is less than or equal S and keep track of such a subset with maximum sum. 
// Time complexity => O(2^n) and n is at most 40. 2^40 will be quite large.

// DP is not practical due to the large value of sum

// OPTIMIZED:
// Meet in the middle => search technique => used when the input is small but NOT as small that brute force can be used. 
// Like divide and conquer it splits the problem into two, solves them individually and then merge them. 

  
// Split => set of integers => 2 subsets say A and B. 
// A having first n/2 integers and B having rest.
// Find all possible subset sums of integers in set A => store in an array X. 
// All possible subset sums of integers in set B => store in array Y. 
// Hence, Size of each of the array X and Y will be at most 2^(n/2).
// Now merge these 2 subproblems. 
// Find combinations from array X and Y such that their sum is less than or equal to S. 

// To make it optimized => sort array Y and then iterate over each element of X => for each element x in X use binary search => find maximum element y in Y such that x + y <= S.
// Binary search here helps in reducing complexity to 2^(n/2)*log(2^(n/2)) which is equivalent to n*(2^(n/2))
